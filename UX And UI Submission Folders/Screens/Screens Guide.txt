Final screens should either be in .pdf format with clear indicators of which buttons lead the user where, or in a publicly-accessible, but not editable, copy of your working figma document.

Previous version screens should indicate development of ideas from PC to touchscreen, as well as any development from responses to feedback.

Make sure that someone who is not logged in to Figma can access your Figma documents!

Screens folder should include a .pdf document clearly indicating your development, feedback, how you responded, and your menu / button / icon for submission requirements
